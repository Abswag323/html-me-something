   <p> In June of 2016, my family and I took a week long trip to Mackinac Island, Michigan and it was 
    one of the coolest places I have been. It has a little something for everyone and will keep you 
    wanting to explore more.</p>
   
   <h2>About</h2>
       <p>Mackinac Island is located off the coast of Northern Michigan in Lake Huron.  It is only 8 miles 
 	around but is packed full of fun! To get to Mackinac Island, we drove from St. Louis, MO to Mackinac 
	City, MI; about a 10 hour drive. The island is then a 40 minute ferry ride from the city. The <em>coolest</em> 
	fun fact about the island is that there is a ban on automobiles. In order to get around, you have a few options:</p> 
   <ul>
     <li>
       	Bicycles - the most common option
     <li>
  	Horse and carriage
     <li>   
   	Walking
     <li>  
   	Scooters
     </li>
   </ul>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this, such as emergency vehicles, snowmobiles in the winter and construction vehicles. When the movie 'Somewhere in 
  Time was filmed on the island, they received special permission to use a car on the island. There is an 8 mile highway called M-185 that runs the 
  perimeter of the island. About 80% of the island is a State Park and has over 100 miles of trails.</p>
   
  <h2>Main Street</h2>
    <p>Main Street is where the majority of the action is, so to say.  You exit the ferry and your greeted with the hustle 
	and bustle of Main Street.  The street is dotted with a variety of shop signs, bikes of all colors lined up and down
	the street, and the sound of horse drawn carriages.</p>

   <h2>Arch Rock</h2>
	<p>Arch Rock is a natural limestone formation that sits 146ft above the shoreline and has one of the best views of the lake. We decided to 
	  take the steps right off M-185 which consisted of 207 steps in total! Talk about getting your cardio in!</p>

   <h2>Grand Hotel</h2>
	<p>The Grand Hotel is another impressive site to see and is nothing short of 'grand'.  It boasts the worlds longest porch and each room has its
	  own style and theme. Your stay here includes a full breakfast, Grand Luncheon Buffet, a 5-course dinner, access to the many shops, golf course, 
	  swimming pool and Ice Cream Parolor. If you wish to visit without staying at the hotel, it will cost you $10 just to enter the grounds plus 
	  access fees for any ammenities. Fun fact: Many distinguuished guests have stayed at the Grand Hote, including 5 Presidents. Another fun fact: 
	  The movie 'Somewhere In Time' was filmed at The Grand Hotel.
